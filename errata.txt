2020-June-23
    check5
        Missing clobber in P0

    MP.RT.inv+dmb+addr
        Incorrect handler made it impossible to tell difference between pagefault and new translation

2020-July-22
    @all
        fixed race condition in locking in the harness that could sometimes
        cause the tool to deadlock.  Whether it caused other issues is unknown.

    CoWT.inv
    CoWT.inv+dmb
    CoWT.inv+dsb
    CoWT.inv+dsb-isb
        Fixed sync handlers. It used to set the sync handler for the incorrect (non-existent) thread.
        Also the handler had no ERET.

    MP.TT.inv+dmb+tpo
    MP.TT.inv+dmb+dsb-isb
        Fixed register write that caused final state to be incorrect.

2020-Aug-10
    check1
    check2
        fixed case where if _both_ loads faulted then the second load's exception handler would also fault
        causing the entire harness to crash.
        More generally tests need to be more resiliant to unexpected faults and have more detection.
