ARMv8-A System Litmus Runner
============================


Build & Run
-----------

Run locally:
```
> make
> make run
```

Run remotely:
```
> make
```

The Makefile will build the ARMv8-A executable `bin/litmus.exe` which can be copied to an ARMv8-A device (such as the Raspberry Pi) with KVM installed
and ran directly.

```
> $ scp bin/litmus.exe pi:
> $ ssh pi './litmus.exe -h'
> Usage: litmus.exe [-h] [-p] [-t] [-d] [-nX]
> -h:      display this help text and quit.
> -d:      enable debug output.
> -t:      enable trace output.
> -p:      switch to pagetable tests.
> -nX:     set number of runs to X (default: 10000)
```

Requirements
------------

To compile locally you need an `AArch64` compiler, such as `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`,  usually installable directly with your package manager.
This should come with `AArch64` compatible `-objdump`, `-objcopy`  and `-ld`, if not, they will need to be installed.

For debugging locally you need `gdb-multiarch`,  again you should be able to just install it with your package manager.


Debugging
---------

For debugging the Makefile generates a `bin/litmus.elf.S` file.
This file contains an objdump of the binary.

Running
```
> make debug
```

will start a local session in QEMU and attach gdb to it,  you can then navigate around in the usual way (example session below):

Note: QEMU loads the binary to location `0x40080000` by default. Exact addresses will vary.


How it works
